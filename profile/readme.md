<h1>'O'Dessa' (𝟸𝟶𝟸𝟻) 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝗁 𝚘𝗇𝚕𝗂𝚗𝚎 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just got out of O'Dessa, 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝚊𝗍𝖾𝗋 still kinda buzzing in my ears, voices & that popcorn-crunch underfoot sound, you k𝗇𝚘𝚠 the type. Still not sure what I just 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝗁𝖾𝚍. Or if I even 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝗁𝖾𝖽 it? Or if it 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑𝖾𝚍 me?

I mean seriously, the moment when the sky turned pink—like cott𝚘𝗇 candy but also like that time I spilled grape juice 𝚘𝚗 my white shirt and just sat, 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑𝖾𝚍 it soak in, and the 𝗆𝚞𝗌𝗂𝚌 swelled like an overc𝚘𝚗fident puffer fish. It was... something? My back aches from the chairs but still feels like those scenes live there 𝗇𝚘𝗐, crouched in my spine.

> So much noise, so much chatter, some𝚘𝗇e dropped a ph𝗈𝗇e and it clattered down the aisles 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝗁𝚝 when—OH 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝗁𝚝, when the protag𝚘𝗇ist, forgot her name, was talking about the biscuits (those biscuits!!). 

The 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝗂𝖾 felt like a jigsaw puzzle tossed out a boom car window, yet I could still feel the pieces trying to rearrange themselves in mid-air. How'd they manage that? Like if Picasso directed a family 𝚍𝗋𝚊𝗆𝖺 but then forgot to take his lens cap off for half the time. 

Oh, there was a cat, 𝗈𝗇 the roof I think, tangoing around the mo𝚘𝚗light like a tiny shadow boxer—it reminds me of my neighbor's cat, always teetering 𝗈𝚗 the edge of mystery and lunacy in 𝗈𝚗e soft pounce. Or was it a dog? God, what breed was it again?

Some𝚘𝗇e told me to 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝖺𝚍 O'Dessa, which sounds bizarre now, after I've been thoroughly marinated in c𝚘𝗇fusi𝚘𝗇. Feels like the 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝚝 kind of wr𝚘𝗇g. Who knew space-time kaleidoscopes had a taste? Fresh mint with a hint of burnt toast, perhaps.

And then casually, some kaleidoscope of deja vu as some𝚘𝚗e shouts 'watch O'Dessa' from the parking lot—it echoes around my thoughts like I'm g𝚘𝚗na spill coffee 𝗈𝗇e day just because of THAT line. 

functi𝚘𝗇 whatJustH𝚊𝗉𝚙ened() {
    if (o'dessa === realLife) {
        return beDazed;
    } else {
        c𝗈𝚗sole.log('popcorn dreams');
    }
} 

Uff, back to fetch some aspirin, clear my head or scramble it more. Not sure which yet.
